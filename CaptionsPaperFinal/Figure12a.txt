Impact of basal melt parameterization (5th, 50th and 95th percentile values of $\gamma_0$ distribution) on basal melt evolution (in Gt/yr) relative to ctrl_proj over 2015–2100. Lines show the mean values, and the shaded background shows the simulation spreads. Note that the y axes differ in all plots.
