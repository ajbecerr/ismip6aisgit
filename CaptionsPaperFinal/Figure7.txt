Evolution of ice volume above floatation (in mm SLE) over  the  2015â€“2100  period  with  medium  forcing  from  the  six CMIP5 models and RCP 8.5 scenario relative to ctrl_proj. Thin lines show results from individual ice sheet model simulations, and thick lines show mean values averaged for each CMIP5 model forcing. Bars on the right show the spread of results in ice flow models and mean values for the six CMIP5 forcings in 2100.
